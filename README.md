<p>I'm currently employed as a Site Reliability Engineer at <strong><a href="https://www.loblaw.ca">Loblaw Inc.</a></strong></p>

<p>Before joining Loblaw, I worked as a Cloud and DevOps Engineer at <strong><a href="https://www.deop.ca">DEOP</a></strong>, a prominent technology company based in Toronto. In this role, I actively contributed to designing and implementing cloud-based solutions for our clients, leveraging my expertise in cloud architecture, DevOps practices, infrastructure management, and cloud security. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, engineers, and project managers, to deliver scalable and resilient cloud solutions that align with our clients' business objectives.</p>

<p>Prior to joining DEOP, I gained valuable experience as a Cloud and DevOps Engineer at <strong><a href="https://www.tbconsulting.ca">Transatlantic Business Consulting</a></strong>, a renowned consulting firm also located in Toronto. During my tenure there, I was responsible for developing reusable Terraform modules to enhance consistency and efficiency in infrastructure provisioning across teams and managing AWS services, including IAM, EC2, VPC, ELB, ALB, and Autoscaling. I ensured adherence to best practices and security standards using Terraform.</p>

<p>By combining my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and effective communication skills, I strive to provide innovative and reliable cloud solutions that drive business growth and efficiency. I am passionate about staying up to date with the latest advancements in cloud technologies and continuously expanding my knowledge to deliver the best outcomes for my clients.</p>
